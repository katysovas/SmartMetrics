# GitHub Copilot vs Amazon CodeWhisperer

As a developer, I've been keeping a close eye on the AI-powered coding assistant battle between GitHub Copilot and Amazon CodeWhisperer. These tools have revolutionized the development process, making it more efficient and enjoyable. Let's dive into the details of each and compare their pros and cons.

## GitHub Copilot

Developed by GitHub and OpenAI, powered by OpenAI's Codex model
Streamlined integration with major code editors
Optimized for seven major programming languages and supports many frameworks
A subscription-based model with a 60-day free trial, free for verified students and maintainers of popular open-source projects

**Pros:**

Easy to use
Wide language and framework support
Large user base, over 1.2 million developers during the technical preview

**Cons:**

Some concerns regarding privacy and data collection
May suggest insecure or outdated code patterns

## Amazon CodeWhisperer

Developed by Amazon and trained on in-house and open-source code
Focused on first-class support for AWS APIs
Currently in preview and free to use during this period

**Pros:**

Great for AWS development
Integrated vulnerability detection for Java and Python projects
Offers options for content sharing during the preview phase

**Cons:**

Limited language and IDE support compared to Copilot
Still in preview, meaning the potential for bugs and instability

GitHub Copilot offers broader language and IDE support, and it's been around longer, allowing for more refinement. However, if you work primarily with AWS, Amazon CodeWhisperer might be the better option due to its focus on AWS APIs and integrated vulnerability detection. As technology advances, AI-powered coding assistants like these will likely become must-have tools for developers.
